# Buba-App — BubaMemoir

## 🧠 Motivation

My father, at 83 years young, has an inspiring passion for technology. Whether he's exploring the internet, drafting chapters of his autobiography, or curating cherished family photos and videos, his enthusiasm for learning and creating is truly remarkable.

Yet, he lacked a dedicated digital space — a personal archive where he could safely preserve, organize, and share his life's work.

This project was born from that need.

I built this platform as a heartfelt gift to him — a secure, cloud-powered space where he can store his writings, manage multimedia content, and revisit his memories with ease. It’s more than just a content management app; it’s a digital legacy hub tailored for someone who proves that the love of learning knows no age.
